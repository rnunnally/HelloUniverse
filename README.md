Learning to create a new repo
The problem that I solved was setting up an account with GitHud and untilizing their platform to help me set up new repos for listing how I fixedthe problems.I entered all personal info and made selections on what I needed and selected categories that best suited my queries. The data I used was by going to www.githud.com and from their My modeling results were that I created an account and got busy setting up my first repo folder. I am now on my way. My model results is that now the account is fully setup and I may access it by using my created user name and password. My eceommendations for solving the problem is that each user will need to set up a free acccount in order to get access to GitHud and down the line one may utilize their paid subscription as it applies.
